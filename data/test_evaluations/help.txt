    - [DATASET_NAME]_predictions: All the predictions made by the three models discussed (Baseline, JITLine, and JITGNN). 
      The columns indicate both the probability returned by the models and the predictions by setting the threshold to 0.50. 
      That is, the samples that have probabilities higher than 0.50 are considered to be predicted as bug-inducing. 
      All other files of the [DATASET_NAME] are subsets of the data in this file.

    - [DATASET_NAME]_all_correct: The commits all three models predict correctly (the prediction and the actual label match).
    
    - [DATASET_NAME]_all_incorrect: The commits all three models predict incorrectly (the prediction and the actual label are different)
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_correct_others_incorrect: The commits JITGNN predicts correctly but Baseline and JITLine predict incorrectly.
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_base_correct_line_incorrect: The commits JITGNN and Baseline predict correctly but JITLine predicts incorrectly.
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_line_correct_base_incorrect: The commits JITGNN and JITLine predict correctly but Baseline predicts incorrectly.
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_incorrect_others_correct: The commits JITGNN predicts incorrectly but Baseline and JITLine predict correctly.
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_base_incorrect_line_correct: The commits JITGNN and Baseline predict incorrectly but JITLine predicts correctly.
        
    - [DATASET_NAME]_gnn_line_incorrect_base_correct: The commits JITGNN and JITLine predict incorrectly but Baseline predicts correctly.

[DATASET_NAME] is either "apache" or "openstack".
